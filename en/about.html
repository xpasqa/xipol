          The Political Science Program under the Faculty of Social and
          Political Sciences (FISIP) UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung was officially established
          in 2018 based on the Decree of the Director General of Islamic Education No.
          283/KPT/I/2018. Since its inception, this academic program has emerged as
          part of the <em>wider mandate</em> scheme of UIN Sunan Gunung Djati
          Bandung, marking the expansion of scholarly domains beyond
          traditional Islamic studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          From its inception, the Political Science Program has demonstrated unwavering commitment to
          academic excellence. This commitment was validated in 2021 when the program
          achieved "Good" accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for
          Higher Education (BAN-PT) through Decree No.
          13549/SK/BAN-PT/Akred/S/XII/2021. In 2022, a comprehensive
          curriculum revision was implemented to align with
          contemporary political science developments and FISIP's academic framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program has been led by two Department Heads: <br />• Dr.
          H. Asep A. Sahid, M.Si. (2018–2023)<br />• Dr. Hasan Mustapa,
          S.Fil.I., M.Si. (2023–present)
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure sustainability and enhance competitiveness, the Political Science
          Program actively promotes faculty and staff development through
          curriculum enhancement, pedagogical innovation, and
          intensified research and community engagement activities.
          The program also facilitates faculty participation
          in local, national, and Southeast Asian academic forums, while
          establishing training and empowerment centers to strengthen
          students' <em>soft skills</em>.

            <p>Graduates of the Political Science Program at UIN Bandung have played strategic roles across various
              important sectors in national development. They actively serve as election organizers at the General
              Election Commission (KPU), Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu), and polling station levels, as well as
              legislative expert staff, civil servants in government institutions, and civil society activists in
              various NGOs. Their sharp analytical capabilities and contextual understanding of politics have earned
              graduates trust in public policy formulation and implementation.</p>
            <p>Many alumni have pursued master's degree education domestically and internationally through LPDP,
              Ministry of Religious Affairs, and other institutional scholarships. They contribute as academics,
              researchers, and political consultants who provide intellectual contributions on issues of democracy,
              governance, and human rights. This trajectory demonstrates that Political Science graduates are not only
              intellectually adaptive but also actively engaged in scientific and policy development schemes.</p>
            <p>Additionally, several alumni have emerged as political communicators and social influencers who shape
              public opinion through media, digital campaigns, and social movements. They represent a new generation of
              critical, communicative, and integrity-driven young Muslim intellectuals who champion values of justice,
              diversity, and participation. Alumni achievements reflect the synergy between academic competence,
              spirituality, and strong social commitment.</p>

        <p>Education serves as the primary pillar implemented through lectures, academic discussions, and project-based
          interactive learning. The Political Science Program strives to develop students who not only understand theory
          but are also capable of applying it in real socio-political contexts. The curriculum is designed to meet
          contemporary needs and remain relevant to local challenges and Southeast Asian regional issues.</p>
        <p>Research is developed as a means of strengthening the scientific capacity of students and faculty. The
          program actively promotes research collaboration between faculty and students through internal research
          schemes, external partnerships, and participation in national and international academic forums. This enables
          students to be directly involved in data-based academic processes and critical analysis.</p>
        <p>Community service is implemented through community-based social programs, training, policy advocacy, and
          political literacy activities. Tridharma is not merely a formal obligation but serves as the foundation for
          character development and the Political Science Program's tangible contribution to building a participatory
          and democratic society.</p>
